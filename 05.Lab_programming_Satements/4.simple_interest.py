# 4. Find the Simple Interest on Rs. 200 for 5 years at 5% per year.

# Given values are as follows:
principal = 200  # as in Rs.
rate_of_interest = 5  # as in %
time = 5  # as in years

# formula for calculating Simple Interest is:
simple_interest = (principal * rate_of_interest * time) / 100

# printing the result
print(f"The Simple Interest on Rs. {principal} for {time} years at {rate_of_interest}% per year is Rs. {simple_interest}.")
